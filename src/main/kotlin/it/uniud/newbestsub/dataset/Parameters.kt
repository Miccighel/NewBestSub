/*
 * Parameters
 * ----------
 * Centralized container for all run-time settings that control a single execution
 * of NewBestSub. This version adds deterministic execution support while preserving
 * backward compatibility with existing constructor calls.
 *
 * Deterministic mode:
 *  - Set `deterministic = true` to request a reproducible run.
 *  - Provide `seed` to fix the master seed explicitly. If `seed` is null and
 *    `deterministic` is true, a stable seed can be derived externally
 *    (e.g., Tools.stableSeedFrom(Parameters)).
 *
 * Backward compatibility:
 *  - New fields were appended with default values, so positional constructor
 *    calls compiled against the previous signature continue to work unchanged.
