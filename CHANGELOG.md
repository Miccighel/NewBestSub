## [Unreleased]

### Added
- Nothing yet.

## [2.0.4] - 2025-09-03

### Changed
- Clarified **NATURAL vs INTERNAL** correlation and the per-target selection rules for FUN and TOP across docs and tests.

### Fixed
- Program: early `-po â‰¥ #topics` validation and clearer runtime error handling (CLI vs runtime validation).

## [2.0.3] - 2025-08-29

### Changed
- Container folder names now include the iteration token when provided by CLI.
- AVERAGE CSV/Parquet filenames omit the iteration token by design.
- `numberOfIterations` is assigned at the start of `DatasetModel.solve()` to ensure consistent naming across modes.

## [2.0.0] - 2025-08-24

### Added
- Comprehensive KDoc for test classes:
    - `DatasetModelTest`: Base64 helpers, AVERAGE path semantics, percentiles, round-trips, edge cases, token/log path helpers.
    - `BestSubsetSolutionTest`: fixture setup, bit toggle semantics, bit capacity, copy value-semantics.
    - `BitFlipMutationTest`: operator semantics, single-bit flip invariants, Hamming distance checks, capacity preservation.
    - `DatasetViewTest`: FUN/VAR global sort, TOP replace-batch behavior, Base64 normalization, cleanup helper.

### Changed
- Unified documentation style across tests:
    - Section dividers preserved for readability.
    - Converted inline comments into structured KDoc.
    - Emphasized invariants and expected outcomes in test docs.

### Fixed
- CSV/Parquet test assertions now explicitly cover:
    - Global FUN/VAR rewrite order by `(K asc, corr asc)`.
    - Base64 prefix checks for VAR/TOP lines.
    - Percentile completeness in AVERAGE path tests.

## [1.0.0]

### Added
- Initial public release of **NewBestSub**.
